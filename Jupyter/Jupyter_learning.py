#1 Matplotlib inline 
"""
is a backend command in Jupyter Notebooks that enables the rendering of Matplotlib plots directly below code cells. 
This means that when you execute code that generates Matplotlib plots, the plots are displayed inline within the notebook,
rather than in a separate window or output cell.
